# DominionGameGenerator

An [open source website](https://dominiongame.azurewebsites.net/) created to help choose the starting cards for games of [Dominion](http://riograndegames.com/Game/278-Dominion). This project was also created by a backend .Net developer to help get his feet wet in front end development.

In a game of Dominion, 10 different types of cards are selected to be a part of the game. The game provides a way of randomizing the starting setup by providing a deck of cards consisting of one card of each type, which you can shuffle in order to choose the cards to use for the game. Once you add a number of the expansions, however, choosing cards from all of them becomes a more daunting task. The website was designed to simplify this part of the setup, allowing you to more easily play with cards from a number of the expansions.
